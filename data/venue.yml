  <strong>Something, Berlin!</strong>
  Who wants to suffer in the urban jungle?
  This year’s eurucamp heads out of town to the biggest of
  Berlin's abundant lakes, the Müggelsee. Talks will
  take place at the Hotel Müggelsee.
  <br />
  Activities will take place around (and possibly in) the lake.
