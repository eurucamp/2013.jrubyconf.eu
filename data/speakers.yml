    name: Charles Nutter
    company: Red hat Inc.
    title: Optimizing Ruby
    bio: |-
      Charles works on JVM languages at Red Hat, focusing on Ruby but expanding
      to other languages soon. He has worked on JRuby for the past eight years
      and has been a JVM enthusiast since Java 1.0. Charles hopes to make JRuby
      the best Ruby implementation for high performance, big data, and heavy
      loads, and to use lessons learned from JRuby to help the JVM and other
      languages that run on it meet their potential.
    paper: |-
      Over the past 6 years, my focus on the JRuby project has usually been
      performance. I've worked on JRuby's bytecode compiler, optimizations
      to the runtime and core classes, improvements to memory use and
      allocation rates, and the removal of concurrency bottlenecks. Over
      that same time we've managed to increase JRuby's performance by orders
      of magnitude, in some cases approaching the speed of compiled Java.

      This talk will go over the major performance leaps we've had during
      that time, starting with the disabling of ObjectSpace and proceeding
      through recent enhancements like instance-variable packing and backref
      framing. You will gain a better understanding of what makes Ruby fast
      or slow, how you can write more efficient Ruby code, and what
      implementations like JRuby are doing to make Ruby perform even better
      in the future.

    title: JRuby Pain Points
    bio: |-
      Thomas Enebo is the co-lead of the JRuby project and an employee of
      Red Hat. He has been a practitioner of Java since the heady days of
      the HotJava browser, and he has been happily using Ruby since 2001.
      Thomas has spoken at numerous Java and Ruby conferences, co-authored
      "Using JRuby", and was awarded the "Rock Star" award at JavaOne.  When
      Thomas is not working he enjoys biking, anime, and drinking a decent
      IPA.
    paper: |-
      All applications and libraries have their pain points. JRuby is no
      exception. Thomas will examine JRuby's pain points and reflect on the
      perception of pain.  He will finish by talking about some future plans to
      address these pain points.

    company: Burt
    title: The tip of the iceberg / Don't worry about scaling Rails
    bio: |-
      Theo is Chief Architect at Burt, a Göteborg based big data startup that
      wants to revolutionize the advertising industry by showing that there's
      more to ad analytics than clicks. He learned to build distributed systems
      the hard way by building a real time analytics platform that now handles
      billions of requests per day.

      He is a frequent speaker at developer conferences around Europe, where he
      favors topics such as JRuby, big data and distributed systems. In his
      hometown of Göteborg he co-organizes the Ruby, Scala, JavaScript and
      distributed systems user groups.

      But his only real claim to fame is that he has more reputation on Stack
      Overflow than both Jeff and Joel.
    paper: |-
      You've probably heard people say that Rails can't scale. Perhaps you've
      even reached that conclusion yourself. It may or may not be true, but
      it's besides the point. Scaling Rails is not the issue, scaling your
      application is.

      This talk is not about Rails. It’s about building scalable applications
      using Ruby, how to look beyond Rails and into the realm of distributed
      systems. Over the last few years I’ve built a real time ad analytics
      platform that processes billions of messages per day -- it started as a
      Rails application and ended up somewhere completely different. Let me
      show you the good, and the bad, choices I made, and what I learned along
      the way.

    title: "Performance in JRuby: How fares the JVM in day-to-day tasks?"
    bio: |-
      Benoit is an open-source evangelist and a benchmark freak.
      He is now an MRI committer and enjoys contributing to many projects
      including JRuby, Rubinius and Homebrew.
      He has been working last summer with the Google Summer of Code program
      and had the chance to have @enebo as a mentor.

      He started talks about benchmarking at the Belgian Ruby User Group a
      couple years ago and gave a [talk](http://2012.jrubyconf.eu/speakers) at
      JRubyConfEU/eurucamp last summer.
      Between these, he gave various talks about Ruby and Git at my university
      ACM Student Chapter.
      attended a bunch of conferences including RubyConf, EuRuKo, ArrrrCamp
      and of course eurucamp.
    paper: |-
      About everyone has heard JRuby is fast, but *how* fast is that?

      This talk is about giving you a concrete idea of it, with realistic
      use-cases of popular libraries, efficient programming contests solutions
      and day-to-day tasks from reading a file to analyzing a web app. There
      will be a comparison with other Ruby implementations as well as with
      various languages and VMs, highlighting pros and cons of the JVM.

      Jano is a developer, amateur musician and addicted to conferences. He has
      created from small webapps to complex enterprisey architectures and has
      spoken in plenty of latin american conferences, currently the CTO of
      [HopIn](http://hop.in). During his free time he plays music and tries to
      practice sports (without much success).
    paper: |-
      Maybe after years of Java you have adopted an style that's not
      immediately transferable to Ruby. In this talk you will know the
      experience of someone who spent many years programming in Java before
      falling in love with Ruby. We will explore how to stop worrying and
      embrace dynamic typing, adopting a more declarative style of programming
      and some of the nice things you can do now that you are using Ruby.

      Javier is a web developer working mainly in Ruby on Rails projects since
      2006 and one of the founders of teowaki, a web service designed to make
      software development teams happier.

      He is also the author of the book “Aptana RadRails: An IDE for Rails
      Development” and an active member of the Ruby scene, being a founding
      member of the Spanish Rails Conference, the Spanish Ruby Users Group

      Railscamp.

      He is currently based in London —with regular trips to Madrid. In the
      past he’s worked in Zaragoza, Brescia, New York, Barcelona and Madrid.
    paper: |-
      With the adoption of REST, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets,
      and the second coming of JavaScript, exposing our applications as a
      service is now more important than ever.

      Rails or Sinatra make really easy to create a (kinda) RESTful API but, in
      many occassions, these APIs are designed without really thinking on the
      developers that will have to use them.

      I want to talk about some of the points that can help making your API
      more developer-friendly. Some of the areas I’ll cover will be
      discoverability, authentication, headers, formats, parameters,
      documentation and tools.

      I will also provide a few tips about how to build your application first
      as a service, then adding the web/mobile/presentation layer.

    title: RoR + DynamoDB = ?
    bio: |-
      Silvia is a consultant at innoQ with a strong scientific background in
      developing RESTful applications. She has just started to explore the
      world of Ruby (on Rails) and co-organized Rails Girls Rheinland.

      She enjoys diving into new technologies with a focus on developing
      RESTful applications, e.g., with NodeJs and Clojure, and using NoSQL
      databases.

      Up to now she gave talks on scientific conferences but now it is time to
      solve real problems and share the experiences.
    paper: |-
      We are currently developing a Ruby on Rails application with Amazon's
      DynamoDB. Using a NoSQL cloud service and especially DynamoDB with its
      particular restrictions entails a lot of challenges.

      We will share our experiences using DynamoDB in general and in
      combination with Ruby (and Rails) to help you to decide if you want to
      use DynamoDB for your project (or not). We also provide a list of things
      you should to keep in mind if you start using DynamoDB. These range from
      managing your database, over mapping your model to the database, up to
      testing. Furthermore, we present the design and technical details of our
      persistence module.

      It is 16:39 on a friday afternoon when your boss walks over.
      "I urgently need an overview of the number of Archer Towers that players have built. Could you please generate a little histogram before you go home?"
      You start to sweat. There are over a million player files on disk ...

      Kernel threads -- or being able to utilize all cores from a single process
      -- is a JRuby killer feature. In this talk, I will show how a fully
      operational "Mini Hadoop" can be built in fifty lines of JRuby. I will
      also demonstrate live on stage that it saves the day in the imaginary
      scenario described above.

    title: Live long and prosper with Celluloid and JRuby
    bio: |-
      Ben is a regular contributor to
      open-source, agile proponent and harbours an almost unhealthy obsession
      for all things concurrent and distributed. Ruby, Go and Scala are his
      first loves. Beards a close second.
    paper: |-
      In this talk you'll learn about the Celluloid ecosystem. We'll take a glance at:

      * Celluloid - the OOP & Actor model based concurrency framework
      * Celluloid::IO - an evented I/O framework
      * DCell - distributed Actors for Celluloid
      * Reel - the Celluloid::IO powered web server

      I'll cover the Actor model - Celluloid's inspiration for their approach
      to concurrent objects. How we can best achieve concurrency without
      mind-bending synchronisation, mutexes, deadlocks and all in idiomatic and
      simple to grasp Ruby.

      We'll finish up by briefly covering JRuby and why it's my preferred Ruby
      VM for concurrency with Celluloid.

    title: krypt & jruby - cryptography's new best friends?
    bio: |-
      Martin is a [freelancer](http://martinbosslet.de) by day, by night he is
      also a member of ruby-core, one of the maintainers of the Ruby OpenSSL
      extension and the author of [krypt](https://gihub.com/krypt/krypt).
      Cryptography is his passion and he truly enjoys it, even if it means
      being the nerd among nerds for the rest of his life. He's been helping
      the European Commission to implement a digital signature platform over
      the past years, and this was also the reason for krypt - so that he
      could do it in a sane language for once. He recently discovered [blogging](http://martinbosslet.de/blog/archives/)
      as a compensation for not haunting other people with lengthy emails
      anymore.
    paper: |-
      As of JRuby 1.7.3, [krypt](https://github.com/krypt/krypt) is being
      shipped with JRuby by default. Currently, krypt is being used to provide
      missing functionality of the OpenSSL extension. Chances are you may be
      using krypt today without even realizing it.

      But krypt's goals go beyond just being a fill-in for OpenSSL - the
      ultimate goal is to replace the OpenSSL extension entirely. See for
      yourself how the Java parts of krypt enable us to run the exact same code
      on all Rubies - no more second class citizens, no strings attached.
      You're fed up with overcomplicated APIs for everyday things like securing
      your passwords or encrypting your data? krypt provides cryptography for
      actual human beings with simple and clear interfaces. There's a
      dead-simple API if all you care about is security, but there's also full
      control for the guys in the ivory towers.  Find out how to extend krypt's
      functionality by integrating Java cryptography libraries.

      Finally, be a witness of something that no other JRuby (or Java)
      cryptography library can give you today: access to arbitrary C
      crypography libraries without having to change your actual Ruby code.

      This is the first game at Wooga with a backend written in JRuby!

      The talk includes an introduction to the problems that were solved by
      choosing a stateful applicaton server.

      I will explain constraints, benefits and obvious differences to
      traditional database backed application servers.

      * Safely sharing state in a concurrent environment using JRuby
      * Using Java concurrency utils in JRuby
      * Sample problems solved, backed up with code

    paper: |-
      Even though JRuby is not officially supported on OpenShift, it's very
      simple to get it there working. In my talk I would like to talk about why
      I think OpenShift is a great platform and JRuby on it makes sense.
      However this would be too simple. In the second part we will get rid of
      all the stacks and will deploy Thick (my hobby project - Netty based web
      server) on OpenShift but straight on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

    paper: |-
      If the Java ecosystem is keeping you from deploying your Ruby
      applications on the JVM, then wait no more. You can deploy your JRuby web
      apps to the cloud using new products from Heroku, RedHat, EngineYard,
      Google, Amazon, and others. You'll learn how one `git push` gives you
      access to true multithreading, clustering, messaging, advanced garbage
      collection, just-in-time compilation and much more. After this talk,
      you'll be able to deploy TorqueBox, Trinidad, and Warbler to a variety of
      cloud platforms.

      and their software camato.

      Martin loves to connect and combine ideas and dream about the future of
      software development.

      Ruby, Scala and Bavarian are his favourite languages and he fluently
      switches between the three.
    paper: |-
      Ruby and Scala are both beautiful languages that allow for functional,
      object-oriented and meta-programming. Both have their uses and
      strengths, so why not become a shape-shifter, a traveller between worlds?
      Using simple meta-programming facilities one can join JRuby and Scala to
      get the best out of both. We will take a simple RSpec'ed JRuby program
      and port it to Scala along green tests.

      You'll get an idea of the many similarities between Ruby and Scala,
      where the two differ and what a compiler can do for you.

      You will see how Scala can be taught to talk to dynamically typed
      languages without the compiler breaking into tears and you will see how
      JRuby can use Scala as a nitro-booster for performance-critical parts.
